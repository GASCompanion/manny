## How can I report a bug or suggest a feature?
If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/issues) to make sure it hasn't already been added. If you don't see it, [open a new issue](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/issues/new/choose).

## How can I contribute?
If you're interested in contributing code, please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Can I invite this bot to my server?
No. Manny is specifically designed to work with Unreal Slackers, and it contains a lot of code that assumes the bot is only present in one server. The main reason the code is open source is to provide the Unreal Slackers community with a way to directly contribute to improving the bot. Hosting your own copy of the bot is not supported. If you decide to adapt any of the code for your own purposes, please respect the [license](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/blob/master/LICENSE).
